# OceanX
# Welcome to the community of ocean x ( FREE)



The reason I created this forum is for the integration of a free BP ocean in unreal engine 4 with very interesting features
The idea is that together we can improve and integrate new functions do not hesitate to support oceanX



Gerstner Waves
Dynamic planar reflection
buoyancy
transparency
Infinite ocean
And many more features
Is similar to the ocean of the community in appearance but in code is very different

This ocean is available in the unreal motor 4 market for free for any use.


The ocean has a wave control which can become much more pronounced than in the image
